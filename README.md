## BOOTCAMPSPOT DYNAMIC SYLLABUS

### “A better spot for bootcamp”

### Issue:
Mandated learning resources, lesson prep materials, and the course syllabus (and their attendant learning objectives) are contradictory in places, under curated in others, and wholly fragmented if not altogether absent. 
BootcampSpot is a hollow and two-dimensional tool as it exists, but one which we believe offers a platform and framework to solve the above issues. By extending BootcampSpot’s ‘Week Sessions’ calendar our team can greatly enhance the learning experience for the course’s students, and the teaching experience for it’s instructors and TAs.

### Fix:
Consolidate student and instructor interaction more centrally to BootcampSpot by extending the functionality of the ‘Sessions’ syllabus. To achieve this we will give the instructor/TAs greater backend or ‘admin’ options toward customizing the syllabus and session specific ‘card’ to enable students to not only log their attendance, but interact with the card dynamically. This can be from posting lesson prep-work and/or resources, to having the students be able to rate that resource and/or post their own resources as they pertain to that lesson. Other things, from a “Raise Hand” button that would alert a TA in real-time as to the student's question, while still enabling instruction to progress, to the hosting of the recorded lesson stream, to the monitoring of student engagement in the lesson via a “page focus” script,  are actively being explored as well.
